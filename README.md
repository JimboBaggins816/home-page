This project from the start was pretty stressful for me.
 Despite all of that it was a great learning experience. 
 With the help of videos and ALOT of google searches I believe I cracked the code. 
 By the time I was finishing the project I couldn't really remember why it was so stressful or hard. 
 What this project taught me. 
 1 css is a lot less complicated when you properly class and id. 
 2 html is a lot more to my liking and more simple for me than css. 
 3 although it was frustrating, searching and finding solutions was not that difficult and using that with a little guess work made the whole thing pretty rewarding in the end. 
 4 I cant say ive ever said this before but I'm looking forward to more complex projects and using those problem solving skills. 
 5 I gained a new found appreciation for people who create beautiful and complex websites.
